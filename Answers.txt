Here is an example of how an API documentation would look like using Python's `json` and `urllib` libraries. This document will include sections to describe the endpoint, URL, request headers, response format, status code, and any additional metadata.

```python
import json

def create_an_api_doc():
    url = 'https://api.example.com/api/v1'

    payload = {
        'description': 'An example API description',
        'endpoint': '/api/v1'
    }

    api_doc = json.dumps(payload)

    response = requests.post(url, data=api_doc)

    return response

def main():
    response = create_an_api_doc()
    print(response)
```

In this code snippet, we define a function `create_an_api_doc` that will make an HTTP POST request to the specified URL with a payload. The returned API documentation is then printed out.

This format ensures consistent and accurate documentation of the API and its functionality. You can customize it further based on your specific requirements by adding additional sections or fields as needed.

Please note this is just one example, and you might need to modify this according to your project's requirements.
